This is the page to handle messages

Step 1 
Display a table containing the messages that the logged in user has received. 
HINT : You can simply read from the cookie set, to check if a user is logged in, if necessary. 
Each row should be structured as follows : 
Date/time, Sender, First few words of the message, 'View Message' button. 
The table should be ordered such that the latest messages are displayed first. 

Step 2
Upon clicking the 'View Message' button, display that specific message with a 'Reply' button next to it. 

Step 3
Above the table in Step 1, make a drop down menu that allows to filter and display messages from only 1 sender at a time. You could use a dynamic select field that takes in as input an array of senders. 

Step 4. 
Upon clicking the 'Reply' button, navigate to the message-compose.php page, where the recipient field is already pre-filled with Sender's name.
