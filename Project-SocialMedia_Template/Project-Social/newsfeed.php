Here you would display the status posts of the current logged in user and his/her friends. 

Step 1
Make a form allowing the logged in user to post a status. 
The form can simply be a textfield and a "Post status" button. Ensure that the user cannot post an empty status though. Some validation is required on the input

Step 2
Make a simple table with rows structured in the following way :
date/time, user, status post



Optional: If you completed all the tasks and are bored, you could also figure out a way to allow the logged in user to interact with his/her friends posts, such as a like system. You may need to modify the database to do this.
